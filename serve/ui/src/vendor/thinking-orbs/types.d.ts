 * - `solving`    — bands scramble in quarter turns, then click back
 * - `listening`  — a waveform rolls through latitude rings
 * - `connecting` — a constellation wires itself, packets running the edges
 * - `weaving`    — three strands plait around the sphere
 * - `composing`  — an undulating multi-band sash
 * - `breathing`  — a face-on ring slowly morphing
 * - `shaping`    — a dotted outline morphs circle → triangle → square
