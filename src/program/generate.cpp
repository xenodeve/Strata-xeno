// src/program/generate.cpp - P2.S6: `strata generate`.
//
// THE DRIVER, and the first program in this project that answers a question.  Everything below it is a
// component; this is the thing that composes them into a token:
//
//     embed_row(token)  ->  48 captured layer graphs (the CPU expert pool behind the doorbell)  ->
//     lm_head(R)        ->  sample        ->  embed_row(next)  ->  ...
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT.  There is no tokenizer here.  `pack/full/tokenizer/` and `tools/strata_tokenizer.py` exist,
// and a C++ BPE is Phase 1's deliverable rather than this program's, so the prompt arrives as IDS via
// `--tokens`.  That is not a placeholder: it is exactly what Gate C1 needs, because C1 compares logits against
// llama.cpp on the SAME ids, and a tokenizer on only one side of that comparison is a second variable.
//
// AND IT IS PHASE 2, so hit rate is `h = 0` and the number it prints is slow on purpose
// (`phase-2-correct-engine.md:5-9`).  What it is FOR is the honest tok/s figure and the logit dump.

//     rewound, so a checkpoint is a copy of exactly these: ~118 MB, the same set the verifier snapshots to roll
